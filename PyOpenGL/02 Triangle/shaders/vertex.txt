//fragment shader: defines how positions are loaded to the gpu

//use opengl version 3.30 in core (modern) mode
#version 330 core

//more complicated programs will have layouts like:
//
// layout:
//	location 0: position
//	location 1: colour
//	location 2: ...
//	right now we're just taking a postion, it's an input variable of type 3D vector (x,y,z)

layout (location=0) in vec3 pos;

// the main program of the shader doesn't return anything, hence "void"
void main()
{
	// The goal is to define the position of a point, this is done by
	// setting it to the gl_position variable. Note that it needs to become a 4D vector with
	// 4th component = 1
	gl_Position = vec4(pos.x, pos.y, pos.z, 1.0);
